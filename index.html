    <p>Housing insecurity is a growing issue in U.S. metropolitan areas. 20% of renters in 25 major cities experience multiple forms of housing insecurity (e.g., forced moves, poor home conditions, high rent burdens). In recent decades, around 8 million very low-income renters are spending more than 50% of their income on rent, without any housing assistance. From 2022 to 2024, people experiencing homelessness rose rapidly from 582,462 to 771,480, after remaining steady for years. Metropolitan areas has particularly high rates of chronic homelessness.

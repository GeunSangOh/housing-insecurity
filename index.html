    <h1>Who Faces Housing Insecurity:<br>
      <span class="subtitle">An Analysis of Renters in U.S. Metropolitan Areas</span>
    
    <h2>I. Introduction</h2>
      
    <h3>A. Background</h3>
    <p>Housing insecurity is a growing issue in U.S. metropolitan areas. 20% of renters in 25 major cities experience multiple forms of housing insecurity (e.g., forced moves, poor home conditions, high rent burdens). In recent decades, around 8 million very low-income renters are spending more than 50% of their income on rent, without any housing assistance. From 2022 to 2024, people experiencing homelessness rose rapidly from 582,462 to 771,480, after remaining steady for years. Metropolitan areas has particularly high rates of chronic homelessness. In short, renters in U.S. metropolitan areas, particularly those with low income, are increasingly vulnerable to housing insecurity.</p>
  
    <h3>B. Motivation and Goals</h3>
    <p>Renters often face multiple forms of insecurity, yet most research has focused on just one aspect. This research addresses the severity of housing insecurity by considering its multiple aspects.</p>
    <p> With this motivation in mind, the resarch goals are as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>Examine the extent and severity of housing insecurity among renters in U.S. metropolitan areas</li>
      <li>Identify key renter characteristics that are strong predictors of housing insecurity</li>
      <li>Inform policies that can improve rentersâ€™ housing security</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>C. Research Questions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>How extensive and severe is housing insecurity in U.S. metropolitan areas?</li>
      <li>What characteristics best represent renters facing housing insecurity?</li>
      <li>Do housing policies, such as subsidized housing and rental assistance, contribute to addressing housing insecurity?</li>
      <li>What characteristics best predict severe housing insecurity?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>II. Dataset and Research Approach</h2>
    <h3>A. Dataset</h3>
    <p>This research used the 2021 American Housing Survey (AHS) dataset. It can be directly downloaded from <a href="https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/ahs/2021/AHS%202021%20National%20PUF%20v1.0%20Flat%20CSV.zip" target="_blank">this link</a>. The 2021 AHS dataset include a total of 64,141 housing unit. From this, I selected a sample of 22,027 housing units corresponding to renter households in metropolitan areas.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            

    <p>I divided the sample into four income groups based on the 2021 federal poverty levels. Using annual income values for 100%, 200%, and 400% of the poverty levels, I have four income groups: very low-income (N=6830), low-income (N=4887), modest-income (N=5318), and higher-income groups (N=4993).</p>

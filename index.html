    <h1>Who Faces Housing Insecurity:<br>
      <span class="subtitle">An Analysis of Renters in U.S. Metropolitan Areas</span>
      
    <h2>I. Introduction</h2>
      <h3>A. Background</h3>
      <p>Housing insecurity is a growing issue in U.S. metropolitan areas. 20% of renters in 25 major cities experience multiple forms of housing insecurity 
        (e.g., forced moves, poor home conditions, high rent burdens). 
        In recent decades, around 8 million very low-income renters are spending more than 50% of their income on rent, without any housing assistance. 
        From 2022 to 2024, people experiencing homelessness rose rapidly from 582,462 to 771,480, after remaining steady for years. 
        Metropolitan areas has particularly high rates of chronic homelessness. 
        In short, renters in U.S. metropolitan areas, particularly those with low income, are increasingly vulnerable to housing insecurity.</p>
      
    <h3>B. Motivation and Goals</h3>
      <p>Renters often face multiple forms of insecurity, yet most research has focused on just one aspect. 
        This research addresses the severity of housing insecurity by considering its multiple aspects. With this motivation in mind, the research goals are as follows:
      <ul>
        <li>Examine the extent and severity of housing insecurity among renters in U.S. metropolitan areas</li>
        <li>Identify key renter characteristics that are strong predictors of housing insecurity</li>
        <li>Inform policies that can improve renters’ housing security</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

    <h3>C. Research Questions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>How extensive and severe is housing insecurity in U.S. metropolitan areas?</li>
        <li>What characteristics best represent renters facing housing insecurity?</li>
        <li>Do housing policies, such as subsidized housing and rental assistance, contribute to addressing housing insecurity?</li>
        <li>What characteristics best predict severe housing insecurity?</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>II. Dataset and Research Approach</h2>
      
    <h3>A. Dataset</h3>
      <p>This research used the 2021 American Housing Survey (AHS) dataset. 
        It can be directly downloaded from <a href="https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/ahs/2021/AHS%202021%20National%20PUF%20v1.0%20Flat%20CSV.zip" target="_blank">this link</a>. 
        The 2021 AHS dataset include a total of 64,141 housing unit. From this, I selected a sample of 22,027 housing units corresponding to renter households in metropolitan areas. 
        I divided the sample into four income groups based on the 2021 federal poverty levels. 
        Using annual income values for 100%, 200%, and 400% of the poverty levels, I have four income groups: very low-income (N=6830), low-income (N=4887), modest-income (N=5318), and higher-income groups (N=4993).</p>

    <h2>III. Phase I: Explore Housing Insecurity Predictors</h2>

    <h3>A. Select Housing Insecurity Predictors</h3>
      <p>From the AHS dataset, I selected several characteristics of renters (including householder and household characteristics), houses, and communities, along with housing policies and regions, as the predictors. 
        The table below presents summary statistics for the variables (predictors) selected for the analysis.</p>

    <h2>IV. Phase II: Create a Composite Index of Housing Insecurity</h2>

    <h3>A. Determine Key Dimensions of Housing Insecurity</h3>
      <p>Based on a review of the existing literature, I determined key dimensions of housing insecurity as Residential Instability, Unfitness and Inadequacy, and Unaffordability</p>

      <img src="./plots/housing_insecurity_dimensions.png" alt="Housing Insecurity Dimensions" style="width: 90%; max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: 20px auto;">

    <h3>B. Create Indicators to Measure Housing Insecurity</h3>
      <p>To measure the key dimensions of housing insecurity, I selected several variables for each dimension from the 2021 AHS dataset and transformed them into nine binary indicators.</p>

      <img src="./plots/indicators.png" alt="Binary Indicators" style="width: 90%; max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: 20px auto;">

    <h3>C. Factor Analysis to Validate Dimensions of Housing Insecurity</h3>
      <p>I conducted an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to examine whether the underlying structure of the nine indicators aligns with the three dimensions of housing security. 
        The EFA results confirm the three-dimensional structure is appropriate, with the nine indicators effectively representing the three dimensions. 
        The scree plot support the adequacy of retaining three dimensions. 
        Also, the high factor loadings of the nine indicators provide evidence for the validity of the three key dimensions they represent.</p>
      
      <table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; margin: 20px auto;">
        <tr>
          <td style="width: 40%;">
            <img src="./plots/screeplot.png" alt="Screeplot" style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px;">
          </td>
          <td style="width: 60%;">
            <img src="./plots/factor_loadings.png" alt="Factor Loadings" style="width: 100%; max-width: 700px;">
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>

    <h3>D. Create a Composite Index</h3>
      <p>I created the composite index of housing insecurity by summing all nine indicators. 
        The values of this index range from 0 to 8. 
        The higher the index value, the more severe the housing insecurity. 
        A value of 0 means that a household faces housing security. A value of 1 or higher indicates housing insecurity, and a value of 3 or higher indicates severe housing insecurity.</p>

    <h3>E. Examine Extent and Severity of Housing Insecurity</h3>
      <p>Overall, 48.6% of renters face housing insecurity, including 22.0% who face two forms of housing insecurity (index value=2) and 6.9% who face severe housing insecurity (index value≥3).
        In the very low-income group, 87.7% face housing insecurity, including 53.4% who face two forms and 17.2% face severe housing insecurity. 
        These findings highlight the strong relationship between income level and housing insecurity among metropolitan renters.

    <h2>V. Phase III: Estimate Housing Insecurity Models Across Income Levels</h2>

    <h3>A. Preprocessing</h3>
      <p>Due to the small number of observations for certain index values in the composite index of housing insecurity, values of 3 and higher were combined into a single value of 3 for the very low- and low-income groups. Similarly, for the modest- and higher-income groups, values of 2 and higher were combined into a single value of 2.</p>

    <h3>B. Establish Variables</h3>

    <h3>C. Estimate Partial Proportional Odds (PPO) Models</h3>
      <p>I used a partial proportional odds model to estimate the impact of the predictors on housing insecurity across four income groups.
        This is an extended ordinal regression model that offers flexibility by allowing predictors to have varying effects across levels of housing insecurity.

    <h3>D. Summary of the Four PPO Models</h3>
      <p> The table below shows relative risk ratios for statistically significant variables in PPO models.<p>
